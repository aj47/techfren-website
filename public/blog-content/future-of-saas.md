# The $9.9 Billion Question: Is the Entire Software Industry Headed for $0?

A viral tweet, a tech celebrity's stark warning, and a mountain of venture capital all point to the biggest debate in tech right now: **Is software as we know it completely doomed?**

Let's start with the poster child of the current AI boom: **Cursor**. It's arguably the most valuable AI coding software in the world, boasting a staggering **$9.9 billion valuation** after a recent $900 million Series C funding round. To top it off, they're reportedly pulling in **$500 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**.

By all traditional metrics, this is a titan in the making. Yet, a growing and influential chorus of voices is arguing that its future value—along with the entire SaaS industry—is headed straight to zero.

Let's break down the argument.

### The Doomsday Prophecy: The Last Human Medium

The recent firestorm was ignited by a [tweet from Jacob](https://x.com/jsnnsa/status/1934427228856611004) that amassed over a million views. In it, and in his accompanying essay, ["The Last Human Medium,"](https://www.workbyjacob.com/thoughts/the-last-human-medium) he lays out a radical vision for the future.

He argues that:

> “in five years, business software will be an oxymoron,” and that “the entire SaaS industry is building for customers that won’t exist.”

The core of his prediction is that AI won't just *assist* developers—it will become the developer. He envisions a future where AI can write entire, perfect, and complex codebases from a single, high-level prompt. In a world where the AI does all the coding, what is the point of a human-centric tool like an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? Humans, he argues, won't need tools; they'll want experiences.

It’s a compelling vision. It's also worth noting that this serves as a setup for his own product, Spawn. While the idea is provocative, the business itself seems to face the same existential questions without a clearly defined moat.

### The View from the Top: GeoHotz's "Worthless" Tier

This sentiment isn't isolated. It's echoed by one of the most respected and iconoclastic minds in tech, George "GeoHotz" Hotz. In a [talk with TBPN](https://x.com/tbpn/status/1935072881425400016?s=46), he broke down the AI value stack into five tiers:

1.  **Energy Providers:** The fundamental power source.
2.  **Fab Manufacturers:** The creators of the physical chips (e.g., TSMC).
3.  **Firmware:** The low-level code that makes the hardware run (e.g., NVIDIA's CUDA).
4.  **Model Providers:** The creators of the foundational models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
5.  **Consumer/Enterprise Software:** The application layer.

His conclusion? Tier 5 is, in the grand scheme of things, **"worthless."** The real, defensible value lies deeper in the stack. Applications built on top are just thin wrappers, easily replaced and commoditized.

### The Rebuttal: The Last Mile Problem

The argument that AI writing code makes SaaS worthless misunderstands where the value of software lies. It's not in the raw code, but in the **productization**—the user experience, the integrations, the reliability, and the solution to a specific, messy business problem. This is the "last mile," and it's where companies are built.

This is precisely why GeoHotz's "worthless" Tier 5 is where so much vital innovation is happening. For example, innovators like [Exo Labs](https://x.com/exolabs/status/1935189970593137018) are focusing on building a better user experience on top of powerful local models, proving that the application layer is far from dead—it's essential for making powerful technology usable. An AI might be able to generate the code for a CRM, but it doesn't automatically create Salesforce.

### My Take: The Great Job Race and the World After Work

This brings us to the future of the software engineer. Do I think the job is safe forever? No. **I believe the role of a software engineer will eventually disappear.**

However—and this is the critical point—by the time that happens, the entire world will be completely different. The disappearance of the SWE role will be a footnote in a much larger story where the very concept of "jobs" as we know them has been rendered obsolete by advanced AI.

The real question isn't *if* SWEs will be replaced, but *in what order*.

The software engineer's role will first evolve. It will move up the abstraction ladder to become more like a **Product Manager or a high-level problem solver**, whose main job is to define problems, architect systems, and direct the AI's creative power.

The hardest part of engineering isn't writing code; it's the final 20% of the work—the complex, frustrating, and context-heavy process of debugging—that takes up 80% of the time. Before AI is good enough to master that, it will have already mastered tasks that are far more structured and information-based.

That's why jobs like **doctors, lawyers, accountants, and consultants** are more vulnerable in the short term. Much of their work involves synthesizing vast amounts of text-based knowledge and generating structured outputs—a task at which LLMs already excel.

The future of software isn't its absence, but its transformation. And the software engineer won't be the first to leave the stage; they'll be among the last to turn off the lights.
