\nand then the second one could be YouTube\n\n00:01:44 \nand we will try get it to go to like\n\n00:01:46 \nWWW YouTube dot com slash at tech friend\n\n00:01:50 \nsomething similar for TikTok.\n\n00:01:52 \nThat's a simple flow\n\n00:01:55 \nlet's see if we can figure it out to\n\n00:01:57 \nfor this to work\n\n00:01:58 \nit needs to know the context of\n\n00:01:60 \nthe first thing it created\n\n00:02:02 \nand then be able to\n\n00:02:04 \nlink it with the flow that I just linked it\n\n00:02:07 \nso I'm gonna say rename Title 1 to contact us\n\n00:02:11 \nTitle 2 to YouTube\n\n00:02:14 \nand Title 3\n\n00:02:18 \nto TikTok and\n\n00:02:20 \nlink them according to\n\n00:02:24 \nthe diagram\n\n00:02:25 \nby creating a new contact us page and just linking to\n\n00:02:31 \nthe relative so shh\n\n00:02:34 \nmedia links.\n\n00:02:37 \nAlright, so it's created the updated HTML code\n\n00:02:41 \nso we're gonna just edit that okay\n\n00:02:43 \nso this is the updated site contact us\n\n00:02:45 \nYouTube and TikTok oh\n\n00:02:47 \nit added it all in the one thing\n\n00:02:49 \nbut the TikTok and YouTube links work\n\n00:02:52 \nand it removed the

Okay,\n\n00:00:07 \none thing that I've noticed is\n\n00:00:09 \nour snake starts as white,\n\n00:00:10 \nso it's hard to tell which one is our snake.\n\n00:00:12 \nSo I'm gonna say tweet, colon,\n\n00:00:14 \nchange the starting color of layers snake to blue,\n\n00:00:21 \nsubmit the issue,\n\n00:00:22 \nand Sweep.

Yes, this is perfect.\n\n00:00:42 \nLook, I'm looking for the relevant snippets,\n\n00:00:45 \nand I've decided to make the following modifications.\n\n00:00:47 \nIn the snake class,\n\n00:00:48 \nchange the default colour from white to blue.\n\n00:00:50 \nAnd it's making a PR.\n\n00:00:51 \nThis flow making a pool request is the like,\n\n00:00:55 \nthe ideal flow.\n\n00:00:57 \nHow it works is the software engineer manager\n\n00:00:59 \nor the senior software engineer\n\n00:01:01 \nor even the business admin. So\n\n00:01:03 \nyou don't even actually need to be a software engineer.\n\n00:01:05 \nNow, a business admin could make this issue on Github.\n\n00:01:09 \nThe developer picks up the issue and submits a PR.\n\n00:01:12 \nThen the senior developer can look over the PR,\n\n00:01:15 \ndo the code review,\n\n00:01:16 \nand merge it in.\n\n00:01:17 \nSo right now\n\n00:01:18 \nwe'll check the Pool request\n\n00:01:19 \nboom, here we go.\n\n00:01:20 \nBrilliant PR.\n\n00:01:21 \nSo this is better than what I would do.\n\n00:01:22 \nI'm too lazy to write this.\n\n00:01:23 \nLook at description in the nice title.\n\n00:01:26 \nThis PR.

Right.\n\n00:01:60 \nSo let's see if Sweep AI can fix that.\n\n00:02:03 \nMake a new issue.\n\n00:02:04 \nWe like sweep\n\n00:02:06 \nextend the snake loss to take in a color for the snakes.\n\n00:02:13 \nAnd change the AI\n\n00:02:15 \nsnake file to initialize the snakes as random colors.\n\n00:02:21 \nAnd I'm gonna make it an optional\n\n00:02:23 \nso we don't have to specify it for the player.\n\n00:02:26 \nOkay, let's see if we can do this.\n\n00:02:27 \nSo I'm gonna try\n\n00:02:28 \nmake it so that the AI snakes are all random colors.\n\n00:02:31 \nSome palaces\n\n00:02:31 \ncan't believe it can even do OOP\n\n00:02:33 \nobject oriented programming.\n\n00:02:35 \nI can believe that.\n\n00:02:35 \nI'm just impressed with this whole\n\n00:02:37 \nlike, approach.\n\n00:02:38 \nThat is all.\n\n00:02:39 \nWe think it hub.\n\n00:02:40 \nI think that's a great solution.\n\n00:02:41 \nLooking At the code. Yes,\n\n00:02:43 \nthese are the right files.\n\n00:02:44 \nIt should change.\n\n00:02:45 \nIs this made a pool request yet? Yes.\n\n00:02:47 \nExtend the snake class to accept optional color\n\n00:02:49 \nand initialize snakes with random color.\n\n00:02:52 \nUm, actually,\n\n00:02:54 \nlet's make the pie first. Okay.\n\n00:02:55 \nYes, it's added the optional color.\n\n00:02:58 \nAnd yet. Perfect.\n\n00:02:59 \nThat's perfect.

can't break at all.\n\n00:01:58 \nso if I just try to break at the start\n\n00:01:60 \nlegal break statement\n\n00:02:01 \nfor each has to go through every element in the array.\n\n00:02:04 \nnext up

actually a string.\n\n00:02:16 \ncareful of that.\n\n00:02:16 \nunlike the first one.\n\n00:02:18 \nthis one is actually a string.\n\n00:02:19 \nwhereas with the traditional for loop\n\n00:02:21
